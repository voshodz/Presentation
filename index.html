          <h3>Linus Torvalds</h3>
          <h4>(Finnish Software Engineer Who is the Main Developer of the 'Linux' Operating System)</h4>
        </section>
				<section>
          Linus was born in Helsinki, Finland, the son of journalists Anna and Nils Torvalds, and the grandson of poet Ole Torvalds. 
          His family belongs to the Swedish-speaking minority (roughly 5 %) of Finland's population. 
          Torvalds was named after Linus Pauling, the American Nobel Prize-winning chemist, although he prefers to claim he was named after Linus in the Peanuts comic strip. 
          Both of his parents were campus radicals at the University of Helsinki in the 1960s. His father was a communist who in the mid-1970s spent a year studying in Moscow.

          Linux was initially developed by Linus Torvalds in 1991
          as an operating system for IBM-compatible personal computers based
          on the Intel 80386 microprocessor.

              Set of code which directly interacts with hardware and allocate
              manages resources such as CPU time, memory and I/O access.
              Kernel also contain system calls which provide specific functions.
            </li>
            <li>
              It's a program that runs in Kernel mode
            </li>
            <li>
              CPUs run either in Kernel Mode  or in User Mode.
            </li>
            <li>
              when in User Mode, some parts of RAM can't be adressed, some 
              instructions can't be executed, and I/O ports can't be accessed.
            </li>
            <li>
              besides running in Kernel mode, kernels have peculiarities: large size,
              machine dependency,
              loading into RAM at boot time

              <li>
                The File System is accessed through system calls such as: open, read, write...
              </li>

              <li>
                Instead of putting code to manage  the HW controller into every application,
                the code is kept in the Linux kernel.

              <li>Every process (except init) in the system is create as the result of a fork system call</li>
              <li>the fork system call splits a process into two processes (Parent and child)</li>
